# eROSITAViz
This repository offers a quick and convenient way to visualize light curves and spectra from eROSITA DR1. Additionally, it provides users with these data files in *txt format.

eROSITAViz enables users to explore the available eROSITA data with just the input of the target's name or coordinates.

### First step
To get started, follow these steps to download the repository and install the required dependencies:

```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/javiserna/eROSITAViz
$ cd eROSITAViz
$ python setup.py install
```
### How to use it?
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use the tool as follows:

If you have the target name (Only SIMBAD Names), run:

```zsh
$ python erositaviz.py "Star_name"
```
Alternatively, if you have the coordinates RA, DEC, run:

```zsh
$ python erositaviz.py "RA" "DEC"
```
This will display the eROSITA light curve and spectra for the specified target.
For your record, the *txt data files and plots are saved in the "downloads" folder in the working directory. Enjoy exploring eROSITA data!

### Example
The star "AB Dor" is known to be a strong X-ray source, so an active star. The eROSITA products are:
